            <h2>1. What is React?</h2>
            <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a
                community of individual developers and companies. React allows developers to create reusable UI
                components and efficiently update and render components when the data changes.</p>

            <h2>2. SPA vs. MPA</h2>
            <p>Single Page Applications (SPAs) load a single HTML page and dynamically update content as the user
                interacts,
                providing a smoother user experience. Multi-Page Applications (MPAs) load new pages from the server in
                response to user actions.</p>

            <h2>3. React vs Angular vs Vue vs NextJS</h2>
            <p>Compare popular JavaScript frameworks and libraries, including Angular, React, Vue.js, and Next.js.
                Evaluate their strengths, weaknesses, and use cases.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Library vs Framework</h2>
            <p>Understand the differences between a library and a framework. React is often referred to as a
                library due to its focus on building UI components, while frameworks provide a more comprehensive
                structure for application development.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>5. DOM vs Virtual DOM</h2>
            <p>Explore the concepts of the Document Object Model (DOM) and Virtual DOM. React uses a Virtual DOM to
                optimize updates and improve performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the actual DOM.</p>

            <h2>6. One-way Data Binding vs Two-way</h2>
            <p>Examine the concepts of one-way data binding and two-way data binding. React follows a one-way data
                binding approach, where data flows from parent components to child components.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>7. JSX</h2>
            <p>JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript, often used with React. It allows you to
                write HTML elements and components in a syntax similar to XML or HTML. JSX is then transpiled into
                JavaScript.</p>
